# uwx/json-minify
A fork of [JSON.minify](https://github.com/getify/JSON.minify) designed for node.js (and other CommonJS like Webpack or RequireJS).
The only change in this fork is that it exports the minifier function as a module rather than injecting it onto the global scope.

For more information, see the original [README](https://github.com/getify/JSON.minify#json-minify).
